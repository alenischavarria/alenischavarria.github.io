Hello, welcome to my portfolio! It is a work in progress because I am also attending graduate school to get my Masters of Science in Computer Science. 
I plan to make updates to my portfolio at least Tuesdays and Thursdays. If I find time during the other days of the week, I'll make updates then as well.
I will be using HTML and CSS.
Happy looking!
